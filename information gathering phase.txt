information gathering phase 

from https://github.com/ivan-sincek/penetration-testing-cheat-sheet

notes that need to be included into the program

1. reconnaissance

check if the website is alive or not using the httpx 

	apt-get install httpx-toolkit

	httpx-toolkit -o subdomains_live.txt -l subdomains.txt

	httpx-toolkit -random-agent -json -o httpx_results.json -threads 100 -timeout 3 -l subdomains.txt -ports 80,443,8008,8080,8403,8443,9008,9080,9403,9443

gau ---- to get urls frmo the wayback machines

	#!/bin/bash

	echo "Enter the URL of the website to extract URLs from: "
	read url

	echo "Extracting URLs from $url ..."

	gau $url | sort -u > urls.txt

	echo "Extraction complete. URLs saved to urls.txt"

	---------------------------------------------------------

	getallurls somedomain.com | tee gau_results.txt

	for subdomain in $(cat subdomains_live.txt); do getallurls "${subdomain}"; done | sort -uf | tee gau_results.txt

theharvester----------- to get the information about the websites 

	includes the subdomain to find from the source like hte baidu, bing like search engine 

amass --- which is used to subdomain enumaration and ip address mapping 

	#!/bin/bash

	# Function to run Amass and output subdomains and IP addresses
	function gather_info {
	  # Set the domain to target
	  domain="$1"

	  # Set the output directory for Amass
	  outdir="./amass"

	  # Run Amass in passive mode and output to a text file
	  amass enum -passive -d $domain -o $outdir/$domain.txt

	  # Output the subdomains to the console
	  echo "Subdomains:"
	  cat $outdir/$domain.txt | grep $domain | awk '{print $1}'

	  # Output the IP addresses to the console
	  echo "IP addresses:"
	  cat $outdir/$domain.txt | grep $domain | awk '{print $2}'
	}

	# Call the function with a domain argument
	gather_info "example.com"

Sublist3r  --- which is used to find the enumarate the subdomains
	
	sublist3r -o sublister_results.txt -d somedomain.com

Subfinder --- which is used to find the subdomain which is similar to the sublist3r but need to change the wordlist

	subfinder -silent -timeout 5 -nW -r resolvers.txt -d somedomain.com | tee subfinder_results.txt

dig ---- which is used find the dig command is a DNS lookup tool that is often used for information gathering during the reconnaissance phase of a security assessment or penetration testing engagement. It allows you to query DNS servers to obtain various types of information about a domain name, such as IP addresses, MX records, and more.


	#!/bin/bash

	# Define function to gather information using dig
	function dig_info {
	  # Ask user for domain name
	  read -p "Enter domain name: " domain

	  # Query for DNS records using dig
	  echo "Querying DNS records for $domain..."
	  echo ""

	  # Query for A records
	  echo "A records:"
	  dig $domain A +short
	  echo ""

	  # Query for MX records
	  echo "MX records:"
	  dig $domain MX +short
	  echo ""

	  # Query for TXT records
	  echo "TXT records:"
	  dig $domain TXT +short
	  echo ""

	  # Query for NS records
	  echo "NS records:"
	  dig $domain NS +short
	  echo ""
	}

	# Call the function
	dig_info

DNSRecon --- DNSRecon is a popular open-source tool for DNS enumeration, reconnaissance, and information gathering. It can be used to discover hosts, subdomains, IP addresses, and associated network infrastructure for a given domain. DNSRecon can perform various types of DNS queries, including standard, reverse, brute-force, and dictionary-based queries. It can also perform zone transfers and test for common DNS misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. DNSRecon is commonly used by security professionals and penetration testers to gather intelligence about a target network, identify potential attack vectors, and assess the overall security posture of an organization's DNS infrastructure.

	#!/bin/bash

	read -p "Enter the domain name to scan: " domain

	echo "Performing DNS enumeration for $domain"

	# Run DNSRecon with various options to gather information about the domain
	dnsrecon -d $domain -a -t axfr -t brt -t srv -t tld -t zonewalk -r /usr/share/dnsrecon/namelist.txt

	echo "DNS enumeration completed"

	--------------------------------------------------------- checking the reverse dns 

	#!/bin/bash

	# Check if dnsrecon is installed
	if ! command -v dnsrecon &> /dev/null
	then
	    echo "dnsrecon not found. Please install dnsrecon first."
	    exit
	fi

	read -p "Enter the IP address to perform reverse DNS lookup: " ip_address

	# Perform reverse DNS lookup using dnsrecon
	dnsrecon -t rvl -a -n $ip_address

urlhunter --- URLHunter is a reconnaissance tool used for discovering and extracting URLs from various sources such as web pages, HTML, Javascript files, CSS files, and more. It can be used in information gathering phase to discover web pages and assets that may not be readily visible or indexed by search engines. This tool can be particularly useful for identifying hidden subdomains, directories, or files that may be vulnerable to attack.



	#!/bin/bash

	echo "Enter the website URL (e.g. example.com): "
	read website_url

	echo "Running URLHunter on $website_url..."

	urlhunter -u $website_url -o urlhunter_output.txt

	echo "URLHunter scan completed. Output saved to urlhunter_output.txt."


whatweb --- The tool is often used in information gathering and reconnaissance for penetration testing and security auditing purposes. By identifying the software used by a website, an attacker can search for known vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system.

	#!/bin/bash

	# Prompt the user for the target website URL
	read -p "Enter the target website URL: " url

	# Use whatweb to gather information about the website
	whatweb_output=$(whatweb $url)

	# Print the output
	echo "$whatweb_output"

eyewitness --- Eyewitness is a tool used for website reconnaissance, which means it is used to gather information about a website or web application. It can take screenshots of web pages, generate reports of open ports and applications running on the server, and scan for common vulnerabilities. Eyewitness is often used by penetration testers and security researchers to identify potential attack vectors or vulnerabilities in web applications.


	#!/bin/bash

	# Prompt the user to enter the target website
	read -p "Enter the target website: " target

	# Check if the Eyewitness tool is installed
	if ! command -v eyewitness &> /dev/null; then
	    echo "Eyewitness is not installed. Installing..."
	    sudo apt-get update
	    sudo apt-get install eyewitness -y
	fi

	# Run Eyewitness with the target website
	echo "Running Eyewitness..."
	eyewitness -d ./eyewitness-output -t "$target" --web --no-prompt

	echo "Eyewitness scan complete. Output saved to ./eyewitness-output directory."
